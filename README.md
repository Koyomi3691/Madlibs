# Madlibs
Mad Libs is a word game where one player prompts another for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story; these word substitutions have a humorous effect when the resulting story is then read aloud. The game is especially popular with American children and is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime.
This small project is created by using python.
Hope you have fun playing this!!
